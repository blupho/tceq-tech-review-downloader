write an app to automated the process of pulling Technical Review documents from TCEQ Records Online (https://records.tceq.texas.gov/cs/idcplg?IdcService=TCEQ_SEARCH)
How to pull Technical Review manually:
    1. In the first drop down menu, select AIR/New Source Review Permit
    2. In the lower section, select Central Registry RN, enter the RN number, example: RN100223445
    3. Enter Technical Review in the third section and click Search
    4. In the search results, look for Technical Review in Title Column and look for the desired dates in Begin Date 
    5. Click links in Content ID column and download the document
The app should automate the process. It should have a place to enter the RN number and the date range to narrow down the results. It needs to provide links to download the documents returned from the search.
